Surrealist is the official query playground, data explorer, and schema designer for [SurrealDB](https://surrealdb.com/). Connect to any SurrealDB server and execute queries in a graphical interface, including intelligent auto completion, syntax highlighting, and much more. Switch to the explorer view to browse database tables, edit record contents, and traverse graph relationships. Use the designer view to create or modify your database schema, and manage logins and scopes with the authentication view.

## How to use
You can [read our documentation](https://surrealdb.com/docs/surrealist) for information on how to use Surrealist.

## Web App
You can use Surrealist by visiting https://surrealist.app/

While the web app provides a convenient and easy way to use Surrealist, the desktop app offers additional features such as an integrated database runner and offline support.

## Desktop App
You can download the latest version of Surrealist Desktop from our [Releases](https://github.com/surrealdb/surrealist/releases) page. This version provides significantly more functionality over the web app, so it is considered the recommended way to use Surrealist.

## Features

### Local database
You can start a local database directly from the application by pressing the start button in the top right. Doing so will start up a SurrealDB instance using the credentials and port entered for the current tab.

You can choose whether the local database is stored in memory or stored on disk on the Settings screen.

This functionality is currently only available in the desktop app.

### Query view
Use the Query View to execute queries against your database. You can define variables in the Variables panel and use them in your queries, and browse the results in the Results panel.

Executed queries are saved to the Query History or can be manually saved to the Favorites panel to quickly access previous queries.

### Explorer view
The Explorer View is used to browse your database and inspect individual records. When you select a table in the left panel, the table contents will be displayed in the Record Explorer. You can click on a record id to open the Record Inspector, in which you can edit the record contents and traverse graph relationships.

### Designer view
The Designer View is a powerful tool you can use to define and manage your database schemas. You can create tables & edges, modify the database schema, and visualize the database tables in a graph view.

### Authentication view
Use the Authentication View to manage access to the database by creating namespace logins, database logins, or scopes.
