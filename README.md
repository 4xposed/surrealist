Surrealist is a simple to use Browser and Desktop based query playground and database explorer for [SurrealDB](https://surrealdb.com/). You can connect to any SurrealDB server and execute queries in a graphical interface, including table & variable auto completion, syntax highlighting, and much more. Switch to the explorer view to browse database tables, edit record contents, and traverse graph relationships. Use the designer view to create or modify your database schema, and manage logins and scopes with the authentication view.

## How to use
You can [read our documentation](https://surrealist.starlane.studio/) for information on how to use Surrealist.

## Web App
You can use Surrealist by visiting https://surrealist.app/

While the web app provides a convenient and easy way to use Surrealist, the desktop app offers additional features such as an integrated database runner and offline support.

## Download
You can download the latest version of Surrealist Desktop from our [Releases](https://github.com/StarlaneStudios/Surrealist/releases) page.

### Running on MacOS
When running Surrealist on MacOS, as the application is not signed, you may be prompted that the file is damaged and can't be opened. If this happens, try the following steps:

- Move the downloaded `surrealist-xxx-darwin-arm64.tgz` outside of your Downloads folder (to add Surrealist to your Launchpad, place it in the `/Applications` directory)
- Extract the application from the tgz file
- Delete the tgz file, as it is no-longer needed
- Open the Terminal app and navigate to the directory you extracted Surrealist into
- Run the command `sudo xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine Surrealist.app` (You may be prompted to enter your password)

If these steps don't work, please open an issue ticket.

## Local database
You can start a local database directly from the application by pressing the start button in the top right. Doing so will start up a SurrealDB instance using the credentials and port entered for the current tab.

You can choose whether the local database is stored in memory or stored on disk on the Settings screen.

This functionality is currently only available in the desktop app.

## Query view
Use the Query View to execute queries against your database. You can define variables in the Variables panel and use them in your queries, and browse the results in the Results panel.

Executed queries are saved to the Query History or can be manually saved to the Favorites panel to quickly access previous queries.

## Explorer view
The Explorer View is used to browse your database and inspect individual records. When you select a table in the left panel, the table contents will be displayed in the Record Explorer. You can click on a record id to open the Record Inspector, in which you can edit the record contents and traverse graph relationships.
